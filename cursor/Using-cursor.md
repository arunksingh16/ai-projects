# Using Cursor

- Cursor blocks access to files listed in `.cursorignore`.
- Always index. To see indexed file paths: `Cursor Settings > Indexing & Docs > View included files`
- Use `.cursor/rules`, You can have multiple rules file inside different folders
- Use MCPs, not too many, only Important ones
- Use different Model for different jobs. I go with Claude for Planning and OpenAI models for implementation
